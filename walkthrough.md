From the summary statistics you can tell a few things, there are a few columns with missing observations such as field goal percentage and free throw percentage, but most of the columns have full observations.

This graph shows the points per game for players that shot higher than 50% from 3 for the season. As you can see, only one player had more than 8 points per game with most players having well below that. This illustrates how difficult it is to maintain that high of a 3 point percentage with volume shooting.
